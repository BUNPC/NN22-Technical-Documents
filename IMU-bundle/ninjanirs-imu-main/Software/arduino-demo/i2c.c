  i2c_io - write and read bytes to an I2C device

  Usage:      status = i2c_io(device_addr, wp, wn, rp, rn);
  Arguments:  device_addr - This is the EIGHT-BIT I2C device bus address.
              Some datasheets specify a seven bit address.  This argument
              is the seven-bit address shifted left one place with a zero
              in the LSB.  This is also sometimes referred to as the
              address for writing to the device.
              wp, rp - Pointers to two buffers containing data to be
              written (wp), or to receive data that is read (rp).
              wn, rn - Number of bytes to write or read to/from the
              corresponding buffers.

  This funtions writes "wn" bytes from array "wp" to I2C device at
  bus address "device_addr".  It then reads "rn" bytes from the same device
  to array "rp".

  Return values (might not be a complete list):
        0    - Success
        0x20 - NAK received after sending device address for writing
        0x30 - NAK received after sending data
        0x38 - Arbitration lost with address or data
        0x48 - NAK received after sending device address for reading

This "i2c_io" I2C routine is an attempt to provide an I/O function for both
reading and writing, rather than have separate functions.

I2C writes consist of sending a stream of bytes to the slave device.  In some
cases the first few bytes may be the internal address in the device, and then
the data to be stored follows.  For example, EEPROMs like the 24LC256 require a
two-byte address to precede the data.  The DS1307 RTC requires a one-byte
address.

I2C reads often consist of first writing one or two bytes of internal address
data to the device and then reading back a stream of bytes starting from that
address.  Some devices appear to claim that that reads can be done without
first doing the address writes, but so far I haven't been able to get any to
work that way.

This function does writing and reading by using pointers to two arrays
"wp", and "rp".  The function performs the following actions in this order:
    If "wn" is greater then zero, then "wn" bytes are written from array "wp"
    If "rn" is greater then zero, then "rn" byte are read into array "rp"
Either of the "wn" or "rn" can be zero.

A typical write with a 2-byte address and 50 data bytes is done with

    i2c_io(0xA0, wbuf, 52, NULL, 0);

A typical read of 20 bytes with a 1-byte address is done with

    i2c_io(0xD0, wbuf, 1, rbuf, 20);
