## Development Log

*2023-08-07* Testing Rev 2.0 board with wireless link

All good.  Only issue is that channels 3 and 4 are swapped.

*2023-05-22* Look at Hammond box 1593XAL.  Nope!  Maybe 1598B?

Meeting with Bernhard.  Agreed-

* Proceed with new design for Hammond box
* Add an LDO on USB power input to run on e.g. 4.1V
* Adjust component values, update a few circuit issues
* Measure I-V curve on logic inputs to radio Tx, ensure 2N3904 can drive them

*2023-05-19* Footprinting and initial placement

*2023-05-17* Test Rev1a boards

*2023-05-15* Capture initial schematic in KiCAD
