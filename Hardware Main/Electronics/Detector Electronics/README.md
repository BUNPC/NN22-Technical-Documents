All detector related files are located within this folder.

Two versions of the backplane are available, the 6 layer and single layer. The 6 layer folder contains the files for the full height backplane to allow for up to 6 detector interface cards to be connected and the single layer folder contains the files for the system configuration with only one interface card per backboard slot.
